				<h2>Freedom Is The Best Way to Block Social Media on Your Devices, But......</h2>
				<p class="postdate">May 5, 2019</p>
				<p>I will soon be doing a deep dive into several popular &quot;distraction blocker&quot; apps. These are tools that make it very difficult to access distractive apps or websites. </p>
				<p>Distraction blockers can be an invaluable tool when we are first learning to sever our dependency from our digital addictions. </p>

				<p>However, they come with a huge asterisk that their product pages often omit. <!--more--></p>
				<h4 id="adding-a-button-to-block-other-buttons">Adding a Button to Block other Buttons</h4>
				<p>There is something dystopian about our modern society that people pay to add digital buttons to their lives that block them from pressing other digital buttons. </p>
				<p>The use of apps like <a href="https://freedom.refersion.com/c/b112ec">Freedom</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en">StayFocused</a>, or <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc">Forest</a> inherently requires some degree of techno-optimism, the belief that new technology will fix all problems that are created by previous technologies. (Spoilers: It won&#39;t.) </p>
				<p>Blindly believing that these apps will fix our complex issues of social media addiction, online shopping craze and video game compulsion is ludicrous. </p>
				<p>Oftentimes when testing these apps, I figured out a loophole in their programming, only to block that loophole, only to &quot;crack&quot; them in another way. Ultimately, I&#39;d find a way to binge Youtube with a laughably roundabout method. </p>
				<p>Why? Maybe I&#39;m addicted. But that explanation is too reductionist to be the whole picture. </p>
				<p>Our digital addictions are merely symptoms of underlying problems. Some of our necessary needs are not being met, and we&#39;re using digital distractions as a bandage. </p>
				<p>It could be loneliness, lack of meaning in real life, boredom, stress, physical health, unawareness of our own habits, or any combination of them. </p>
				<p>It&#39;s no fault of <a href="https://freedom.refersion.com/c/b112ec">Freedom</a>&#39;s developers that their service is not an all-encompassing therapy service that cures our digital addictions. </p>
				<p>In fact, after having tested pretty much every distraction blockers out there, I recommend <a href="https://freedom.refersion.com/c/b112ec">Freedom</a> as the best cross-platform distraction blocker. </p>
				<p>I use it daily to block distractive games and websites during my working hours, and it helps me focus by making it too much of a hassle to procrastinate. </p>
				<p>It won&#39;t, however, solve all my problems. </p>
				<p>On a fundamental level, it all boils down to living an intentional life. </p>
				<h3 id="ask-what-life-do-i-want-to-live-">Ask &quot;What life do I want to live?&quot;</h3>
				<p>And start from there. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying my best to do for the past decade, failing most times, but sometimes coming out with valuable insight. </p>
				<p>It is the fundamental goal of this blog to explore how to use technology intentionally since otherwise, the technology will use you instead. </p>
