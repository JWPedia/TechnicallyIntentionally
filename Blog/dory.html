				<h2>An Obituary to a Guy Named Dory</h2>
				<p class="postdate">Oct 29, 2019</p>
				<p><i>This is first of many creative writing pieces that will now be part of this blog.</i></p>
				<p>This is an obituary to a guy named Dory. People saw in him a proud young bluefin; a sea of compliments to his radiant blue scales.</p>
				<p>When Dory was five his delusions appeared. His father and mother and brother and friends were all azure. And yet all he saw in the mirror were heinous stripes of red and white, like a damsel's lips and her wedding dress. He saw a joker, a clown fiesta, a reflection of his distorted guts under his skin.</p>
				<p>When Dory was ten, he roamed the reefs with his pals. He drowned in an allure of belonging - he was one of the cool bluefins. Yet as the gang dissolved and the high subsided, he ceased to be one. He just felt blue. Blue like his room's paintwork, the schoolbag, the model train toy, the t-shirts, all colored by his sex he did not choose.</p>
				<p>When Dory was fifteen, his voice had grown as deep as the seabed trenches. He started shaving. He wondered if he could shave this suffocating mask of skin. He bled, he cried. He wondered, how does one stop the current? How does one fight what is invisible? Will the tides ever turn?</p>
				<p>He fought, and he died a warrior. It is for his valiant efforts that I dedicate this obituary.</p>
				<p>I once knew a guy named Dory. He is gone now. Only a girl named Nemo remains. She is the bravest captain that I have ever known.</p>
