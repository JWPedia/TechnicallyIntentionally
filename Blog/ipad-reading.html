				<h2>Erik Barker Reads Books From His iPad</h2>
				<p class="postdaate">April 30, 2019</p>
				<p>I recently shared my strategy for <a href="/Blog/reading-habit">finally making reading into a habit</a>. The key takeaway was to redirect my habit of checking social media on my phone into reading a few pages of an ebook.</p>
				<p>In order to make this change stick, I deleted every single source of distraction from my phone. That shaped my environment to be conducive to reading.</p>

				<p>In my further research about forming reading habits, I came across an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIW5jBrrsS0">interview</a> of Erik Barker, the bestselling author of “Barking Up the Wrong Tree” and the writer of a homonymous blog. (It has an amusing address: <a href="https://www.bakadesuyo.com">bakadesuyo.com</a>.) </p>
				<p>Erik Barker writes incredibly well-researched articles about living better lives through science of human behavior. What he has to say about reading probably has some merit. He says: </p>
				<blockquote>On my phone, I don’t have Facebook, I don’t have Twitter, I don’t have email. My instinct to check social media, I’ve redirected toward the Kindle app. I give myself three checks a day unless there’s an explicit reason where I know there’s an important email coming in. [...] Most of my reading takes place […] on the Kindle app on the iPad. </blockquote>
				<p>His methodology is strikingly similar to mine, and I wouldn’t be surprised if more people independently discovered this “hack” of redirecting our social media cravings into reading more books. </p>
				<p>This method boils down to two simple steps. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Delete all social media and other distractions from your phone or iPad. </li>
					<li>Read books instead of checking social media. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Erik Barker goes on to explain that when we first start forming a habit, we should put in the “minimum viable effort.” That is, start so small that it’s silly to fail. </p>
				<p>Admittedly, setting the bar too high and forcing myself to make drastic changes is a trap that I often fall into. If I&#39;m taking out my phone to instinctively check social media, however, I&#39;m not expected to read a lot. <em>Just read a page while waiting on a line.</em> <em>Just read a few pages while taking a quick study break.</em> The bar is as low as it gets. </p>
				<p>So there’s the key to reading more without putting in more effort. </p>
