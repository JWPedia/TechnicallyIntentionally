				<h2>A Minimal Online Presence</h2>
				<p class="postdate">Oct 20, 2019</p>
				<p>I feel like there is an instinctual and incessant urge to publicize everything on the internet ingrained onto us. Personally, simply reading an opinionated post online can trigger a desire to make an account to deliver a clever rebuttal.</p>
				<p>Perhaps as social animals, we are compelled to digest opinions and have our opinions heard. There are more productive methods, however. For instance, I could read well-researched books and articles, and participate in mutually respectful real-world conversations. Waging a poorly organized, scantly fact-checked culture war on the internet is a waste of time.</p>
				<p>It is not just social media. Why did I find it satisfying to curate my public Goodreads profile? I&#39;m no book reviewer, so I don&#39;t need to publicize it. I don&#39;t need an over-engineered remote database to keep track of books. I can simply create a list myself.</p>
				<p>I&#39;ve come to question this urge for publicity and to minimize my online presence as much as possible. Currently, only this blog remains. It&#39;s minimal - no ads, no follow buttons, no comment boxes. It&#39;s also rarely visited, partly as a direct consequence of my non-existent social media promotion. I&#39;m okay with that. I love this kind of a quiet internet.</p>
				<p>Note that I am not opposed to all online forums and profile curation services. Some can be useful for specific purposes. For instance, an amateur birdwatcher may make great use out of <a href="https://ebird.org/home">eBird</a>, an artist may want to have an <a href="https://www.artstation.com/contests">ArtStation</a> profile, or a developer may use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> for collaborative projects.</p>
				<p>My question is, why do we default to these online services that are often over-engineered for most use cases? Do we ever sit down to question whether these tools are the <i>best</i> way to support our crafts and hobbies? Or simply the convenient default? I suspect that often it is the latter.</p>
