				<h2>A Minimal, Private Mac</h2>
				<p class="postdate">September 26, 2019</p>
				<p><img src="/Media/minimal-mac.png" alt="MacBook Desktop"></p>
				<p>This is what my Macbook&#39;s desktop looks like. It is free from all possible sources of distractions.</p>
				<p>It would be difficult to focus if your workspace was littered with loose documents, empty coca-cola cans, stationeries, and doodles. The same principle applies to our digital environment.</p>
				<p>As a tech-junkie and a computer science student, my laptop is the space that I spend most of my time in. So, I made it into the most focused setup possible.</p>
				<p>It means that I will follow these rules:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Reduce all visual clutter.</li>
				<li>Eliminate all potential interruptions.</li>
				<li>If a task that a digital tool performs is not highly valuable, eliminate said tool.</li>
				<li>Use the simplest technology that accomplishes a valuable task.</li>
				<li>Since advertisements are the enemy of minimalism, use the more private option when two options are otherwise comparable.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2>
				<p>macOS is the simplest commercial desktop operating system. It has a minimalistic design language, and most things <em>just work</em>. Not only that, as a Unix-like OS, working in the command line - the most focused environment possible -  is a breeze.</p>
				<p>That being said, I do not want to police around which OS anyone uses. The rules above can be applied to every OS.</p>
				<h2 id="os-level-settings">OS-Level Settings</h2>
				<p>Here are all the OS-level settings I modify in System Preferences:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>General<ul>
				<li>Appearance: Dark</li>
				<li>Close windows when quitting an app</li>
				<li>Automatically hide and save the menu bar</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Desktop &amp; Screen Saver<ul>
				<li>I chose an understated default wallpaper.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Dock<ul>
				<li>Size: minimum</li>
				<li>Magnification: off</li>
				<li>Automatically hide and show the Dock</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Mission Control<ul>
				<li>Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use: off</li>
				<li>Have only 1 Space open by default</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Screen Time: on</li>
				<li>Security &amp; Privacy<ul>
				<li>FileVault disk encryption: on</li>
				<li>Firewall: on</li>
				<li>Privacy: limit ad tracking, do not share analytics</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
				<p>Notifications inherently violate rule 3: eliminate all potential interruptions. There is only one place where notifications are allowed: out of my life.</p>
				<p>In System Preferences &gt; Notifications, I made some merciless changes.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Nothing goes to the Notification Center</li>
				<li>No app may have a badge icon</li>
				<li>Only Music and <a href="tomighty.org">Tomighty</a> may send out a banner-style notification</li>
				<li>Just in case I missed something, my MacBook is automatically put to Do Not Disturb mode from 9 to 6.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="file-management">File Management</h2>
				<p>My file management system has one goal - to be able to retrieve any needed file quickly from anywhere.</p>
				<p>To do so, clearing the Downloads and Desktop folder every evening has to become habitual.</p>
				<p>All of my files are stored in a single Documents folder that is synchronized to my devices via iCloud.</p>
				<p>iCloud is the most secure cloud storage service out of the big-name options. Other alternatives, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, can and will read your data. For stronger security, you may want to use a zero-knowledge cloud service such as <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync.com</a>.</p>
				<p> Personally, iCloud is the sweet spot between convenience and security. With two-factor authentication enabled and a unique, frequently changed password, iCloud should be secure enough for most users.</p>
				<p>Documents folder is set as the default folder when Finder opens.</p>
				<p><img src="/Media/minimal-finder.png" alt="Document folder organization"></p>
				<p>This is what my Documents folder looks like. I use the tree view to quickly navigate through a deep folder structure with arrow keys.</p>
				<p>The Images folder is where all of my photos live. While Photos is convenient to use, I have had my iPhoto library corrupted enough times to know that a simple folder tree with image files won&#39;t break in the next macOS update.</p>
				<p>The Mastermind folder holds some files for organizing my time. I will defer explaining my rich text productivity system to a later post.</p>
				<p>The Notable folder holds markdown notes. Markdown syntax is easy to learn, platform-independent, and unlikely to break so as long as plain text files exist. I edit markdown files in <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> with <a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced">markdown-preview-enhanced</a> package.</p>
				<h2 id="my-favorite-apps">My Favorite Apps</h2>
				<p>I will discuss some of these Apps and how I set them up in future posts. For now, remember that reducing visual clutter is rule 1 and that using the simplest technology that gets the job done is rule 5. I stick to Apple apps as much as possible.</p>

				<p><img src="/Media/firefox.png" alt="Firefox"></p>
				<p><strong>Firefox</strong> is the most private commercial browser.</p>
				<p><img src="/Media/mail.png" alt="Mail"></p>
				<p><strong>Mail</strong> is my email client of choice.</p>
				<p><img src="/Media/atom.png" alt="Atom"></p>
				<p><strong>Atom</strong> is my favorite text editor. It is what I use to take notes and code simple projects. Coding programs purely in a text editor and command line also happens to be an exercise to improve programming skills. I also use <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong>, <strong>Xcode</strong>, <strong>ImageOptim</strong>, and <strong>Github CLI</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="/Media/tomighty.png" alt="Tomighty"></p>
				<p><strong>Tomighty</strong> is a free and simple pomodoro timer app with no bullshit.</p>
				<p><strong>Calendar</strong> is the simplest, functional calendar app.</p>
				<p><strong>IINA</strong> is my video player of choice. It is like VLC with a mac-native feel.</p>
				<p><strong>Apple Music for Students</strong> is my favorite music streaming service.</p>
				<p><strong>iBooks</strong> is my favorite way to read books.</p>
				<p>While I try to stay away from it, <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> is also installed due to necessity.</p>
				<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
				<p>A minimal Mac setup takes little initial effort and can lead to higher productivity and clarity. I highly recommend any modern knowledge worker to follow some of the steps I described above.</p>
				<p>In upcoming posts, I will discuss minimal iPhone and iPad setup, private web browsing, and rich text productivity system.</p>
