				<p>I recently revisited the book <a href="quality-feb-2019">Digital Minimalism</a>. This time, however, I borrowed a physical copy through my university&#39;s interlibrary loan program.</p>
				<p>The purpose of moving away from my <a href="reading-habit">exclusively digital</a> reading habit is to rediscover some of the lost values of analog: analog reading, analog writing, and analog existence.</p>
				<p>As an experiment, I am going to fully commit to a month-long digital detox as suggested in Digital Minimalism.</p>
				<p>That means the only digital technologies that I am allowed to use are the bare essentials:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>I can use email and browse the web for schoolwork and other necessary purposes.</li>
				<li>I can use a messaging application <em>on a computer</em>  to have video calls with my family back at home.</li>
				<li>I can send text messages and make phone calls.</li>
				<li>I can use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog replacement is not available.</li>
				<li>I can use a computer for programming and related tasks, such as occasionally posting to this blog, experimenting with the bash shell, or using XCode to practice Swift development. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>However, I am not allowed to:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Browse the internet for entertainment, especially Reddit and Youtube.</li>
				<li>Use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog alternative exists.</li>
				<li>Unnecessarily check my phone or email.</li>
				<li>Play video games.</li>
				<li>Consume digital media in a non-social setting.</li>
				<li>Subscribe to any type of feed, such as email newsletters.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To stick to these rules, I made some lifestyle changes:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>I got a paper journal (on which this very post is being written).</li>
				<li>I removed every single non-default app from my phone.</li>
				<li>I removed Windows installation from my desktop computer and installed Pop! OS, an Ubuntu variant, instead.</li>
				<li>I learned the basics of the bash shell so that I can get things done on the command line.</li>
				<li>I borrowed three paper books to read in my leisure time.</li>
				<li>I started wearing an automatic watch instead of using my phone to check my time.</li>
				<li>I started turning off my phone during the day.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the time I have now due to purging digital entertainment, I will be:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Getting work done.</li>
				<li>Reading books.</li>
				<li>Relaxing more.</li>
				<li>Meditating.</li>
				<li>Socializing.</li>
				<li>Going on walks.</li>
				<li>Sleeping early.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I am curious how this detox will go. I will report back in a month.</p>
