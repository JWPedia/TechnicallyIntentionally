				<h2>The iPad's Multitasking Sucks. That's Good.</h2>
				<p class="postdate">May 2, 2019</p>
				<p>Multitasking on the iPad currently just kinda sucks. Heck, trying to use the iPad Pro as a &quot;pro&quot; device is a cumbersome experience in general. </p>
				<p>Rumors about the upcoming iOS 13 hint that there will be a heightened focus on making the iPad into a true laptop replacement. </p>
				<p>A home screen redesign for the iPad will likely better utilize its larger screen real-estate, multitasking will be smoother, and the Files app may see some improvements. Furthermore, users might be able to use an iPad as an external monitor to a Mac. </p>

				<p>Multitasking on the iPad will become easier than ever. Is it a future worth looking forward to? </p>
				<h3>iPad Pro is the world&#39;s best monotasking productivity machine.</h3>
				<p>I noticed a pattern after reading and watching countless iPad reviews. </p>
				<p>The critics unanimously cite the iPad&#39;s inability to multitask on iOS 12 as its biggest flaw, while the diehard iPad users use the iPad precisely because of this &quot;limitation.&quot; </p>
				<p>While macOS&#39;s virtual desktops make navigating the OS a breeze, it is also far too easy to have too many apps and tabs open at the same time. </p>
				<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201606/10-real-risks-multitasking-mind-and-body">Multitasking is harmful to numerous facets of our lives.</a> Monotasking is the way to go. We all know that; it&#39;s been drilled down to us. </p>
				<p>Few realize, however, that they are not monotasking. The mere presence of opened apps and tabs or even the occasional notifications distract our minds and create attention residue. </p>
				<p>iPad brute-forces its users to interact with it with a completely different mindset since only up to three apps can be used at the same time. </p>
				<p>Fans of the iPad Pro often report that their workflow became more focused. They are more productive and have more clarity. </p>
				<h3 id="how-should-apple-approach-multitasking-on-the-ipad-">How should Apple approach multitasking on the iPad?</h3>
				<p>I don&#39;t think anyone disputes that the iPad&#39;s current split-screen feature needs to be improved. On the other hand, the solution isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;Allow us to run macOS on the iPad, Apple you idiot!&quot; </p>
				<p>Multitasking should be an option, not the default. (This notion applies to most things in our life.) </p>
				<p>At the same time, the iPad &quot;Pro&quot; should be able to do more &quot;professional&quot; tasks. Developers can&#39;t rely an iPad Pro because XCode doesn&#39;t run on it, creatives can&#39;t rely on an iPad Pro because Adobe Suite doesn&#39;t run on it, scientists can&#39;t rely on an iPad pro because MATLAB for iPad is a gimped product. </p>
				<p>That&#39;s where <a href="https://www.imore.com/marzipan">Marzipan</a> comes in. With heightened back-end integration between macOS and iOS, it should become much easier to develop for the iPad and macOS at the same time. </p>
				<p>Hopefully, professionals will be able to run their sophisticated macOS tools like the Adobe Suite, XCode, or (the desktop version of) MATLAB on the iPad. Some of it is already happening: recently announced <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/13/adobe-plans-full-photoshop-for-ipad-in-2019/">Adobe Photoshop CC</a> purportedly uses the Marzipan technology. </p>
				<p>The future that I look forward to is not one where multitasking on the iPad Pro is a breeze. </p>
				<p>It is one where the iPad Pro is capable of completely replacing a laptop while retaining its monotasking philosophy. </p>
