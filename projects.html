				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<h3>Ongoing: On Ultralearning Computer Science (2019)</h3>
				<p>One of my favorite bloggers <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com">Scott H Young</a> recently condensed years of his research and writing down to a book, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a>. It came out at an opportune moment, as I switched over to a CS major just two months ago, and the book features lengthy case studies of computer science ultralearing projects. As a late-comer to the field, it is imperative that I employ effective learning strategies to rapidly advance my skill level in order to catch up.</p>
				<p>The goal of this tentative project is to accelerate me past the drudgery of mandatory first-year CS courses alongside regular university curriculum. It is currently at a research and design phase.</p>
