				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, an undergraduate computer science major in the University of Rochester.</p>
				<p>This website is built on the principle that no code is faster than no code. It is written in plain html and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages.</a> No fancy styling nor animations. Fast, minimal, responsive, easy to maintain.</p>
				<p>I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, and simple, intentional living. The <a href="archives">archives</a> page is a collection of my blog posts. The <a href="projects">projects</a> page features my larger, typically more academic, pursuits.</p>
