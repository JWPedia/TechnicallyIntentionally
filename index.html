				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hello, World! I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, a computer science student in the University of Rochester.</p>
				<p>This website is built on the principle that no code trumps no code. It is written in plain html and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages.</a> No fancy styling nor animations. Fast, minimal, responsive.</p>
				<p>I write about a wide range of interests spanning computer science and technology, biological sciences, media criticism, competitive Hearthstone, and deliberate lifestyle design.</p>
				<p>You can also find me on other platforms, such as:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://instagram.com/skaliq_studios">Instagram</a>: Seldomly used for artworks and shoddy wildlife iPhoneography.</li>
						<li><a href="https://anilist.co/user/Skaliq/animelist">Anilist</a>: Anime and manga I watched.</li>
						<li><a href="https://jwinsectlove.blog.me">Naver</a>: This Korean blog was mainly about entomology and hobbyist exotic pet breeding. It is no longer updated, as I fell out of the hobby. All posts are still available.</li>
						<li><a href="index.html">IRL</a>: I know, it's hard to believe. To much surprise to us basement-dwelling hermits, the "real life" expansion is not a hoax. While not my native habitat, I do venture out into it every once in a while.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>While I find it an extraneously difficult to imagine someone stealing content, just in case if you want to: do whatever you want with whatever on this website, so as long as you site your source.</p>

				<h2>Now</h2>
				<p>Inspired by Derek Siver's <a href="https://sivers.org/now">"now"</a> page, here are the essential and things I am doing now.
					<ol>
						<li>Studying computer science. I am working through Princeton's <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a> at the moment. I also solve <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems.</li>
						<li>Spending quality time with my family, friends, and my significant other while summer break lasts.</li>
						<li>Watching all Marvel films in release order so that I can form my own opinions on this decade's biggest cultural phenomenon. (Yes, this project is essential.)</li>
					</ol>
