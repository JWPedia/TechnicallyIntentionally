				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, an undergraduate computer science major in the University of Rochester.</p>
				<p>This website is built on the principle that no code is faster than no code. It is written in plain html and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages.</a> No fancy styling nor animations. Fast, minimal, responsive, easy to maintain.</p>
				<p>I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, competitive Hearthstone, and deliberate lifestyle design. The <a href="archives">archives</a> page is a collection of my shorter articles. The <a href="projects">projects</a> page outlines my larger, typically more academic pursuits.</p>

				<h2>Now</h2>
				<p>Inspired by Derek Siver's <a href="https://sivers.org/now">"now"</a> page, here are the essential things I am doing now.
					<ol>
						<li>Schoolwork, which consists of introductory computer science and biology classes, and a history elective.</li>
						<li>Studying computer science. I am learning Swift development.</li>
						<li>Not forgetting to have some fun with my SO and friends.</li>
					</ol>

				<h2>Boring Stuff</h2>
