				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hello, World! I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, a computer science student in the University of Rochester.</p>
				<p>This website was created as a personal project to learn the basics of front-end web development. This website is built to be minimal, fast, and responsive. It is written in plain html and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages.</a> No fancy styling, animations or plugins. Still, this being a technically minded website, Google's <a href="https://github.com/google/code-prettify">code-prettify</a> and <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">Mathjax</a> are used.</p>
				<p>I have a wide range of interests spanning computer science and technology, the biological sciences, media criticism, competitive Hearthstone, and deliberate lifestyle design. The <a href="archives.html">archives</a> page is a list of all of my articles and projects about these topics. Prospective employers should head over to the <a href="resume.html">resume</a> page instead. You can also find me on other platforms, such as:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://instagram.com/skaliq_studios">Instagram</a>: Seldomly used for artworks and shitty wildlife iPhoneography.</li>
						<li><a href="https://anilist.co/user/Skaliq/animelist">Anilist</a>: Anime and manga I watched.</li>
						<li><a href="https://jwinsectlove.blog.me">Naver</a>: This Korean blog was mainly about entomology and hobbyist exotic pet breeding. It is no longer updated, as I fell out of the hobby. All posts are still available.</li>
						<li><a href="main.html">IRL</a>: I know, it's hard to believe. To much surprise to us basement-dwelling hermits, the "real life" expansion is not a hoax. While not my native habitat, I do venture out into it every once in a while.</li>
					</ul>
