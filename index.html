				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, an undergraduate computer science major in the University of Rochester.</p>

The <a href="archives">archives</a> page is a collection of my blog posts. The <a href="projects">projects</a> page features my larger, typically more academic, pursuits.</p>

				<h2>Now</h2>
				<p>Inspired by Derek Siver's <a href="https://sivers.org/now">"now"</a> page, here are the essential things I am doing now.
					<ol>
						<li>Schoolwork, which consists of introductory computer science and biology classes, and a history elective.</li>
						<li>Having some fun and talk about life with my SO and friends.</li>
						<li>Calling my mom every day.</li>
						<li>Reading a lot, taking long walks, and living mindfully.</li>
						<li>Writing for this blog.</li>
					</ol>
